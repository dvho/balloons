# Balloons
_Balloons_ is an all original game I designed entirely in CSS (no image files) and coded entirely in vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks/libraries).

#### How to Use
_Balloons_ loads instantly in any browser. Tap or click on any balloon to start the game. Rack up points popping balloons before they leave the screen. Don't miss when you pop or else you'll be penalized. Pop the special snowflake balloons to detonate all the others and scoop up points. Pop the special watermelon balloons to gain extra lives. Lose a life when a balloon gets away.

#### Notes
This game is much more difficult when played using a trackpad vs. a mouse or touchscreen device. Zoom out to help increase vertical range.
